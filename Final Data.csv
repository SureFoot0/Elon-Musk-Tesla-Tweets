This is crazy (in a good way)! Since I placed my order, the following things have happened:
-Bigger/better sport brakes added
-Red brake calipers added
-Aluminum pedals added

...And the price went DOWN by $6,000.

There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. 

Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. 

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.

Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing.

Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.

To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. 

I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t. 

Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.

We should be there with Beta 10, which goes out a week from Friday (no point release this week). 

It will have a completely retrained NN, so will need another few weeks after that for tuning & bug fixes. Best guess is public beta button in ~4 weeks.

Good point. We do have torque reduction if an obstacle is detected, but active braking would be better. Prime directive is: do not crash.
